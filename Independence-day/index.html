              Pakistan’s National Flag consists of a dark green field with a
              white crescent moon and a five-pointed star at its center, and a
              vertical white stripe at the hoist side. The flag was adopted on
              11 August 1947, three days before Pakistan's independence.

        <h1 class="sub-heading">The Journey of Pakistan's Independence</h1>
        <p>
          Pakistan’s journey to independence was marked by a long and arduous
          struggle for freedom, culminating in the creation of a new nation on
          August 14, 1947. The flag of Pakistan is not just a symbol of this new
          beginning, but also represents the aspirations and dreams of millions
          of Muslims who envisioned a homeland where they could live with
          dignity and freedom.

            <h2>The Design of the Flag</h2>
            <p>
              The flag of Pakistan was designed by Amiruddin Kidwai, inspired by
              the flag of the All-India Muslim League. The dark green color
              symbolizes Islam and the Muslim majority of Pakistan, while the
              white stripe represents the religious minorities.

            <h2>Symbolism of the Crescent and Star</h2>
            <p>
              The crescent on the flag symbolizes progress, while the
              five-pointed star represents light and knowledge. Together, these
              elements reflect Pakistan’s commitment to Islamic values and its
              aspirations for progress and enlightenment.

            <h2>The Independence Movement</h2>
            <p>
              The demand for Pakistan grew under the leadership of Muhammad Ali
              Jinnah, who became the voice of Muslims in India. The movement for
              independence was fueled by the desire for a separate nation where
              Muslims could practice their religion freely and protect their
              cultural identity.

            <h2>First Independence Day</h2>
            <p>
              On August 14, 1947, Pakistan emerged as an independent nation. The
              flag was hoisted for the first time, marking the birth of a new
              country. This day is celebrated every year with great enthusiasm
              and pride across Pakistan.

              nation where Muslims could freely practice their faith and
              preserve their cultural heritage. His ideas and poetry inspired
